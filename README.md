# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built a page that generates random or chosen book covers, with unique titles, pictures, and descriptions.  The app is solving the problem of creating new book titles for people who need them.  It does this by offering both randomly selected covers and covers with user input.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

- The user must first create GitHub account: 
- Fork the following repository: https://github.com/Kanderson58/romcom-pairs
- In terminal, they will need to run the following to clone down the GitHub repository:
    - git clone https://kanderson58.github.io/romcom-pairs/
- Once the repository has been cloned to their local machine, they can open it in their preferred text editor

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

We were given 5 days and worked 4 of the five, 3-5 hours a day on average.  We are going in week 3 at Turing.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

Write clean, DRY JavaScript
Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Once we completed the project, we went back and refactored to make sure we did not have extraneous code that did not add functionality or value.

Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
- Wrote Javascript and applied it to the given HTML and CSS files.  Successfully manipulated the DOM using Javascript.

Write code collaboratively
Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
- As our first paired project, we were able to communicate effectively and produce code efficiently, allowing all ideas to be heard and implemented.  Committed frequently and exchanged driver/navigator roles each time.  Kept organized branches for each iteration.


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

We were able to truly make connections between our stored data and the website interface.  We ran into difficult areas but overcame challenges with attention to self-care and identifying unproductive struggle, taking appropriate actions to circumnavigate the challenges.  Finishing the project with time to refactor was a big win!
